# pka
This code allows you to make predictions of pKa values including uncertainty (95% confidence). Predictions are based on heteroscedastic boostrap regression of experimental pKa values (`pKa_exp`) versus theoretical pKa values (`pKa_theo`). The only input that is needed is an .xlsx file with two columns of the same length named `pKa_exp` and `pKa_theo`.
